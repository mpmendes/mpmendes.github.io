            Hello! My name is Miguel and I'm curious guy always striving to learn! I'm currently working at Bosch as
            software developer.
            Professionally I am interested in a broad range of topics (they seem to continuously keep growing!), like
            algorithm development, CI/CD systems, container orchestration, perception systems...
            <br>
            <br>
            On my spare time, I like to cook, read, travel, working out and learn new technologies.
            <br>
            <br>
            This website will be the result of one of those endeavours. I will try to continuously update it with some
            of my learnings and other side projects that I might be working on.
            In the meantime, you are invited to take a more detailed look on some of my work.
